# wheelwriter-teletype
This project uses an STCmicro STC15W4K32S4 series micro controller to turn an IBM Wheelwriter Electronic Typewriter into a teletype-like device.

The cable that normally connects the Wheelwriter's Function and Printer boards is removed and the MCU is used to connect the two boards instead. See the schematic for details.

In “typewriter mode”, the MCU transparently passes communications back and forth between the Function Board and the Printer Board and so the Wheelwriter acts as a normal typewriter. In “keyboard” mode, the MCU intercepts commands generated by the Function Board when keys are pressed, converts these commands into equivalent ASCII characters, and outputs the characters through the console serial port. In “keyboard” mode, the commands from the Function Board are not sent to the Printer Board. In “printer” mode, ASCII characters sent to the MCU through the console serial port are converted into commands and sent to the Printer Board. Thus, in “printer” mode, the Wheelwriter acts as a serial printer or "teletype".

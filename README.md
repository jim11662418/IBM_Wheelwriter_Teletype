# wheelwriter-teletype
This project uses an STCmicro STC15W4K32S4 series micro controller to turn an IBM Wheelwriter Electronic Typewriter into a teletype-like device.

The cable that normally connects the Wheelwriter's Function and Printer boards is removed and the MCU is used to connect the two boards instead. See the schematic for details.
